                    <h3>Introduction: </h3>
                     <p>
                         Currently, OSU's process of disseminating information and signing up for events is inconvenient for many students and faculty members. 
                         Because of the need for a smoother process in this area, the business school worked with our team to create an application focused on 
                         school activities. This work will use the React Native framework to build applications that simplify the current release activity flow 
                         and student check-in process. The app is planned to be built for IOS, Android, and Web.

                     <h3>Project vision: </h3>
                     <p>1. Growth Hypothesis: Students and Staff at Oregon State will break the communication barrier that is
                     currently in place surrounding events.</p>
                     <p>2. Value Hypothesis: Attendance at Oregon State events will increase, creating possibilities for more events
                     to take place.</p>
                     <p>3. Functional requirements: The project can offer different functions for students and administrators.</p>
                     <p>4. Non-functional requirements: Students can check in by swiping a student ID card or scanning QR-code.</p>

                    <p>1. Navigation section of the application. </p>
                    <p>2. The Application Calendar section.</p>
                    <p>3. Create event function.</p>

                     <h3>Challenges that I Overcame: </h3>
                    <p>1. I have never used React before and aren't familiar with creating mobile apps.
                     Also no one has really created back-ends before.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Have to worry about security of our app, 
                     and how do we make sure only administrator can create events?
                    </p>
                    <p>3. School Schedules issuse. My team members and I have other 
                    courses/work, so our time is very unpredictable. In addition, 
                    TA and client will design new goals for us every week, which is really challenging for us.

                     <h3>Tools and Technical Approaches: </h3>
                    <p>1. React Native：</p>
                    <p>
                     React Native is the fastest choice for developing applications for the web, Android and iOS. 
                     React Native allows developers to view their code and implementation on a real mobile screen. 
                     Our team members like React Native because it uses JavaScript language and styling similar to 
                     CSS to develop mobile apps, something each member was already familiar with. This allows us to 
                     develop quickly without having to learn tools for each platform. Another advantage of React 
                     Native is it’s modular design, allowing us to use free 3rd party tools. 
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Heroku：</p>
                    <p>This was the best choice for setting up our Express server because it was free to use, easy 
                     to set up, and could scale if we needed it. The only downside to using the free version is 
                     the servers need time to boot up before loading the content, so there is a 10 second wait 
                     if the server hasn't been used recently. </p>
                    <p>3. Postgres: </p>
                    <p>The advantage of Postgres was it is high documentation and Heroku's integration with it. It was 
                    a free to use database that had many easy to use 3rd party GUIs to interact with it. </p>
                    <p>4. AdobeXD: </p>
                    <p>This was the best choice we could have made for planning/designing the application. It's ability
                     to create an interactable interface helped everyone involved to not only see the user interface 
                     but also the user experience of the application.

                    <h3>Question Answer: </h3>
                    <p><b>√ Do you need permission from your teammates and project partner to share certain snippets of code or their intellectual property? </b></p>
                    <p> I don't need permission. I think this project is our common property, and I like that everyone enjoys the process of this project.</p>
                    <p><b>√ How do you distinguish your work from that of the other members of the team? </b></p>
                    <p>We can infer who completed which sections from the data uploaded on GitHub.</p>
                    <p><b>√ What content do you want control over and what do you want your name attached to (on your page and others')?</b></p>
                    <p>There's no part I want to control.Because our project is not for profit. If the project is profitable, I am willing to get my part.</p>
                    <p><b>√ What's the best platform for showing off your work?</b></p>
                    <p>GitHub.</p>
                    <p><b>√ How much detail should you include?</b></p>
                    <p>Contact information, including email address, etc.</p>
